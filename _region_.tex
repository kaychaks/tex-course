\textbf{Font Families}

% One or more blank lines end a paragraph and put the typesetter on a new line.
I \textbf{love} math!

\LaTeX\ does \emph{not} rhyme with ``paychecks''!\\
% The \ after \LaTeX creates a small horizontal space. Try leaving it out.
% The \\ at the end creates additional vertical space between lines.
% See Lesson Six for more on spacing.
% In most cases, \emph and \textit look the same.

\textbf{Math Enviroments, Superscripts, and Subscripts}

The numbers 3, 4, and 5 are a Pythagorean triple because $3^2+4^2=5^2$.\\
% The dollar signs ($) open and close the inline math environment.

We all     know      that $(x^n)'=nx^{n-1}$, but what is $(x^x)'$?\\ 
% Note that the typesetter ignores multiple spaces as above.

The recursive definition for the Fibonacci numbers is 

$F_1=1$, $F_2=1$, and $F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}$ for all integers $n>2$.\\

Compare $\frac{1}{a+b}\neq\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}$ to the following.

$$\frac{1}{a+b}\neq\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}$$
%The double dollar signs ($$) open and close the displayed math environment.

We can also display it midline by using ``display-style'': 
$\displaystyle\frac{1}{a+b}\neq\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}$.\\
% Make sure your typeset quotation marks look right!
