\textbf{Font Families}

% One or more blank lines end a paragraph and put the typesetter on a new line.
I \textbf{love} math!

\LaTeX\ does \emph{not} rhyme with ``paychecks''!\\
% The \ after \LaTeX creates a small horizontal space. Try leaving it out.
% The \\ at the end creates additional vertical space between lines.
% See Lesson Six for more on spacing.
% In most cases, \emph and \textit look the same.

\textbf{Math Enviroments, Superscripts, and Subscripts}

The numbers 3, 4, and 5 are a Pythagorean triple because $3^2+4^2=5^2$.\\
% The dollar signs ($) open and close the inline math environment.

We all     know      that $(x^n)'=nx^{n-1}$, but what is $(x^x)'$?\\ 
% Note that the typesetter ignores multiple spaces as above.

The recursive definition for the Fibonacci numbers is

$F_1=1$, $F_2=1$, and $F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}$ for all integers $n>2$.\\

Compare $\frac{1}{a+b}\neq\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}$ to the following.

$$\frac{1}{a+b}\neq\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}$$
%The double dollar signs ($$) open and close the displayed math environment.

We can also display it midline by using ``display-style'': 
$\displaystyle\frac{1}{a+b}\neq\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}$.\\
% Make sure your typeset quotation marks look right!

  \textbf{Exercise One: The Basics}
\end{center}

A certain math professor will \textbf{scream} and may even \textbf{cry} if you
confuse the Latin terms \emph{id est}, meaning ``that is to say'' and
\emph{exempli gratia}, meaning ``for instance.''
Compare the following.\\

I adore polynomials, \emph{e.g.}, $x^{4}+x^{2}+1$.


I adore polynomials, \emph{i.e.}, expressions of the form
$a_{0} + a_{1}x + a_{2}x^{2} + \dots + a_{n}x^{n}$,where $a_{0},a_{1},...,a_{n}$ are
constants and $n$ is a non-negative integer.\\

Do you lie awake at night wondering what is the smallest positive integer that
can be written as the sum of the two perfect cubes in two distinct ways? Well,
wonder no more:

$$ 1729 = 10^{3} + 9^{3} = 12^{3} + 1^{3} $$

We all learned in first grade that $(a + b)^{3} \neq a^{3} + b^{3}$, but when we
study modular arithmetic we'll find that the two \emph{are} equal in ``mod 3.''

The famous mathematician Euler (rhymes with ``boiler'' \textbf{NOT} with
``ruler'') used the geometric series formula
$a + ar + ar^{2} + ar^{3} + ... = a / (1 - r)$ to conclude the following

$$ 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - \dots = \frac{1}{2} $$

But we know the formula only applies if -1 $<$ $r$ $<$ 1, so this result is not
valid.
